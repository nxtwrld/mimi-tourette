# Mimi Tourette

A fun browser extension. It looks for emoticons at various websites (originaly
at MimiBazar.cz, hence the name) and replaces them with random curse words.

Hilarity ensues.

## Real purpose of this project

The real purpose of this project is to play with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
and to find good workflow for developing cross-platform browser extensions.
